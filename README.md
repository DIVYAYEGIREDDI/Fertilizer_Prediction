# Fertilizer_Prediction
Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a model or system that can predict the optimal type of fertilizer required for a given crop or agricultural field with respect to Humidity,Moisture,Soil Type,Crop Type,Nitrogen,Potassium,Phosphorous. By accurately predicting the fertilizer requirements, farmers can optimize their fertilizer usage, minimize environmental impact, and improve crop yields. 

Key Components:

Data Collection: The data set which is used to build this model is gatheed from Kaggle website.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove noise, handle missing values, and normalize the data for better model performance. This step 
is used for better understanding of the data.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features from the collected data that significantly contribute to fertilizer requirements. This step helps in reducing dimensionality and improving the model's efficiency.

Model Development: I am using decision trees and KNN machine learning algorithms to build this model. Before testing, I'm trained the model using the preprocessed data and optimize its hyperparameters for improved accuracy. And Decision Tree algorithm gives the optimal solution than the other algorithms in my project.

Model Evaluation: I'm using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or coefficient of determination (R-squared) to assess the performance of the developed model. And also I'm apply Cross-validation technique to validate the model's performance.

I did this project as my class level laboratory project to gain hands-on experience and practical understanding on data science, so I didn't deploy this project.
