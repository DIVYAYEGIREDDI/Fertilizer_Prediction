# Fertilizer_Prediction
Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a model or system that can predict the optimal type of fertilizer required for a given crop or agricultural field with respect to Humidity,Moisture,Soil Type,Crop Type,Nitrogen,Potassium,Phosphorous. By accurately predicting the fertilizer requirements, farmers can optimize their fertilizer usage, minimize environmental impact, and improve crop yields.
